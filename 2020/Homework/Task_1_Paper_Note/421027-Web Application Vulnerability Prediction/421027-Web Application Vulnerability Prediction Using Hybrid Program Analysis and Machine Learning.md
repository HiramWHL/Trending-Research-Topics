# 论文摘要
Due to limited time and resources, web software engineers need support in identifying vulnerable code. A practical approach to predicting vulnerable code would enable them to prioritize security auditing efforts. In this paper, we propose using a set of hybrid (static+dynamic) code attributes that characterize input validation and input sanitization code patterns and are expected to be significant indicators of web application vulnerabilities. Because static and dynamic program analyses complement each other, both techniques are used to extract the proposed attributes in an accurate and scalable way. Current vulnerability prediction techniques rely on the availability of data labeled with vulnerability information for training. For many real world applications, past vulnerability data is often not available or at least not complete. Hence, to address both situations where labeled past data is fully available or not, we apply both supervised and semi-supervised learning when building vulnerability predictors based on hybrid code attributes. Given that semi-supervised learning is entirely unexplored in this domain, we describe how to use this learning scheme effectively for vulnerability prediction. We performed empirical case studies on seven open source projects where we built and evaluated supervised and semi-supervised models. When cross validated with fully available labeled data, the supervised models achieve an average of 77 percent recall and 5 percent probability of false alarm for predicting SQL injection, cross site scripting, remote code execution and file inclusion vulnerabilities. With a low amount of labeled data, when compared to the supervised model, the semi-supervised model showed an average improvement of 24 percent higher recall and 3 percent lower probability of false alarm, thus suggesting semi-supervised learning may be a preferable solution for many real world applications where vulnerability data is missing.

# 主要内容
这篇论文主要提出了一种Web系统中漏洞代码自动检测的方式，主要使用了半监督学习，即使用混合（静态+动态）的数据特征来训练。这种方法克服了传统的监督学习方法中缺少漏洞标记数据的缺点，提高了预测模型的召回率，降低了错误报警的概率。
# 创新点
提出了一种半监督学习方法，使用一种低标记量的数据，即混合（静态+动态）数据的方式来作为输入数据训练，召回率提高了24%，错误报警率降低了3%。
# 目前缺点
1. 动态标记数据提取困难，机器学习方法可解释性差。
2. 静态分析仅涉及计算程序片段。 动态分析仅用于推断验证功能的安全性检查类型，论文将推断的信息用于预测而不是正确性分析
